# RDO Project Easyfix
The RDO Easyfix project is a collection of issues that we consider
"easy to fix".  It is meant as a way to help people begin contributing
to the RDO project.

## I am new to the RDO Project, How can I contribute?
* Check for open [easyfix issues][easyfix-issues]
* Each issue includes the IRC nick of a [mentor](#mentors).
* Read the issue carefully and go through the links attached to issue.
* If you aren't able to understand, join the IRC channel `#rdo` on [Freenode][].
* Contact the mentor regarding the issue, they will help you move forward.

[freenode]: https://freenode.net/

## I want to add an easyfix issue
* Go to [issues][] and file the issue.
* Clearly describe the problem to be solved.
* Include the project name as a tag in the issue title (e.g., a DLRN issue would be tagged with `[DLRN]` as in `[DLRN] Proofread documentation`)
* Add steps to reproduce the problem.
* Add links which will help to understand the problem.
* Add your IRC nickname.
* Add information about where someone can contribute changes.
* Always include a link to the project source code.

## I'm still confused, what should I do?
* Join the [RDO mailing list](https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list) and introduce yourself, or
* Join `#rdo` IRC channel on [Freenode][] and say hello.  Someone is generally around and happy to help.
* The [Packager onboarding guide][onboarding] and [RDO Package Maintainer Guide][maintainer] have useful information.
